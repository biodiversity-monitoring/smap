\title{Generate Geographic Boundary as sf Object}
\usage{
generate_boundary(n_points = 3000)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_points}{An integer indicating the total number of points that form the perimeter
of the rectangle. To accurately form a closed rectangle, the number must be
at least 8 (4 corners with at least one point on each side).}
}
\value{
A \code{sf} (simple features) object representing the rectangular boundary as a polygon.
The function relies on the \code{sf} package to ensure compatibility with spatial operations.
}
\description{
This function generates a rectangular geographic boundary covering the whole globe, specified by
a total number of points. The generated boundary is a simple rectangle with the extremes
being the maximum latitudes (90 and -90) and longitudes (180 and -180). This rectangle
can serve multiple purposes in spatial analysis, such as creating a universal background, or
serving as a basis for cropping or overlaying other spatial data.
}
\examples{
# Generate a boundary covering the whole globe with 3000 points and plot it.
boundary <- generate_boundary(n_points = 3000)
plot(boundary)
}
